## Introduction

Welcome to The Architects Platform! This repository provides an overview and resources for our innovative platform that revolutionizes the world of architecture and design. Whether you're a seasoned architect, a design enthusiast, or simply curious, you've come to the right place.

## What is The Architects Platform?

The Architects Platform is a cutting-edge solution designed to address the challenges and enhance the capabilities of architects and designers. It's an AI-powered platform that empowers professionals and enthusiasts in the field of architecture and design by offering a wide range of features and tools. The Architect is a fine tuned assistant for Architects that assists the architectural development from idea generation to final design product.

## Key Features

- **Initial design concept generation and inspirational designs**
The application should provide a design concept based on the architect's input on the needs of the client and other constraints like location, budget and also generate inspiration designs.

- **Interior design generation and furniture generative fill**
The Architect assists in designing the interiors of houses and buildings by providing designs as well as the setup of tools and furnitures with only a prompt without the need to sketch and render everything.

- **Built in Drawing and Design tool**
Users will have access to built in designing and sketching tools where they can provide their ideas to the Architect to get feedback, suggestion and variations of the design.

- **Drawing to Render generation**
The drawings made on the platform as well as provided from users as images will be rendered into realistic renders within seconds.

- **Design modification and variation**
The Architect will assist in shaping and modifying already made designs as well as sketches based on a prompt and also provides a suggestion and variation for the design

- **Floor plan generation**
The Architect helps in generating floor plans based on specific use cases of the design easily.

- **Market Research Trend Analysis and Cost Estimation**
Based on the design and requirement constraints The Architect helps by analyzing the design needs and estimates the cost of construction based on current market price value and suggests more affordable solutions.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `web/`: Here, you will find the frontend code for the Architect platform, implemented using JavaScript, React NextJs, and Typescript. This directory also includes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the user interface including the APIs.

- `mobile/`: Here, you will find the mobile app code for the architect platform, implemented using Flutter, and Dart. 

- `web/src/app/api`: This directory contains the backend code of the Architect platform, including the API endpoints, database models, and business logic implemented in NextJs Server API and used for both web and mobile app.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a collaborative space for development and improvement of the Architect platform. By making the repository publicly accessible, we aim to foster community engagement, allowing mentors, advisors, developers, contributors, and users to explore the codebase, report issues, and suggest enhancements.

## How Generative AI Models are Solving the Problem

At Innovate Fusion we leverage Generative AI models to enhance the Architect platform's functionality, particularly in the domain of visual generation and modification. The chosen Generative AI models, such as the `stable-diffusion-v1-5` and `xs-architectural-interior-design` models, have been fine-tuned to generate, process and modify architectural images. These models utilize cutting-edge machine learning techniques and deep learning models that utilize diffusion processes to generate high-quality architectural artwork from input design images.

By incorporating Generative AI models into The Architect, we enable architects to get design inspirations before starting their design based on nedds and requests of clients. The architect assists architects in every step of the design step to design interior designs, floor designs as well as built in sketching tool with image modeification based on natural language communication with their AI assistant. This significantly enhances the design process, reducing hours of development and research time wasted in the traditional esign process. It opens up new possibilities for interactive and dynamic architectural design development, making The Architect a powerful assistant for architects.
